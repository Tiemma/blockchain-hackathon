This is the repo for a web3.0 application running ipFS, uport, solidity and node

To run the project, run

```javascript
npm install
```

This would install all the dependencies and make the project ready to be run.

Then, we can run

```javascript
npm run-script dev
```

This would preetify the javascript, start a local testnet using ganache, compile 
and migrate the solidity to the testnet altogether.

Then the server starts and the entire application is accessible.


**NOTE: Still under development

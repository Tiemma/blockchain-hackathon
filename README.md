This is the repo for a web3.0 application running ipFS, uport, solidity and node

To run the project, run

```javascript
npm install
```

This would install all the dependencies and make the project ready to be run.

Then, we can run

```javascript
npm run-script dev
```

This would preetify the javascript, start a local testnet using ganache, compile 
and migrate the solidity to the testnet altogether.

Then the server starts and the entire application is accessible.

The entire application is built to be used to verify the identity of users using the uPort(http://uport.me) application.

Don't forget to star!!!!!!!!



###NOTE: Still under development
